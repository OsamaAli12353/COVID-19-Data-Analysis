# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Project Description
This project involves analyzing COVID-19 and vaccination data for India. The analysis includes:
- **COVID-19 Statistics**: Analyzing the spread, recovery, and mortality rates of COVID-19 across different states.
- **Vaccination Data**: Visualizing vaccination trends, including gender-wise vaccination distribution and the states with the highest and lowest vaccination rates.

## Data Sources
- **COVID-19 Data**: The dataset contains information about COVID-19 cases (confirmed, deaths, and cured) in India, organized by states and union territories.
- **Vaccination Data**: The dataset includes vaccination information by state, including the number of people vaccinated and demographic breakdowns (male/female).

## Key Insights and Visualizations
1. **Statewise COVID-19 Statistics**:
   - The **top states** with the most active COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries.
   - **Recovery and Mortality Rates**: Calculated recovery and mortality rates for each state based on the confirmed cases.

2. **Top 10 States with Most Active Cases**:
   - A bar plot showing the top 10 states with the most active COVID-19 cases in India.

3. **Top 10 States with Most Deaths**:
   - A bar plot showing the top 10 states with the highest number of COVID-19 deaths.

4. **Growth Trend**:
   - Line plot depicting the growth trend of active COVID-19 cases in the most affected states over time.

5. **Vaccination Analysis**:
   - **Male vs Female Vaccination**: A pie chart showing the distribution of vaccinations between males and females.
   - **Most Vaccinated States**: A bar plot showing the top 5 most vaccinated states in India.
   - **Least Vaccinated States**: A bar plot showing the bottom 5 least vaccinated states in India.
